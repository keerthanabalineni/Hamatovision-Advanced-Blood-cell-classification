Blood cell classification using transfer learning is a technique where pre-trained deep learning models are fine-tuned to classify blood cells. Here's how it works:  What is transfer learning?  Transfer learning allows leveraging pre-trained models, trained on large datasets like ImageNet, and adapting them to specific tasks.
